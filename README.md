# IPv4- Delmotte
This is a simple implementation of the _Delmotte's method_ used to facilitate the creation of an IPv4 addressing.

It has been coded in Python in June 2016 as [a Terminal app](previous/IPv4-DelmottesMethod.py).  
I decided to update it with a GUI for iOS devices through the [Pythonista app](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/).
